    "# Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a very simple approach for supervised learning. Though it may seem somewhat dull compared to some of the more modern algorithms, linear regression is still a useful and widely used statistical learning method. Linear regression is used to predict a quantitative response Y from the predictor variable X. Linear Regression is made with an assumption that thereâ€™s a linear relationship between X and Y. The simplest form of Linear Regression is \n",

    "$$f(y) = mx + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where is the equation for a line, where x is the input, m is the slope, and b is where the line crosses the y-axis or y intercept. When mapping multiple inputs to a single output the equation is updated to \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{f}(y) = \\sum w_i * x_i = w_0 + w_1 * x_1 + w_2 * x_2 + \\dots + w_n + x_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this form the $w_0$ represents the y intercept, the combination of $w_1 \\dots w_n$ correlates to the slope of the line, and $x_1 \\dots x_n$ are the inputs. Each instance of $w_i$ specifies how much each $x_i$ contributes to the output.\n",
