# Hidden Genius - Machine Learning

### Curriculum Overview
This project has two objectives:
 1. introduce students to the Python programming language
 2. introduce the concept of Machine Learning (ML)

 The curriculum will be broken down into two separate sessions, the first will cover the basics of the Python language,
 and walk students through examples within the context of preparing a data set for fitting a ML algorithm. The second
 and final session will involve a high level overview of Machine Learning principles, and commence with an explaination
 and tutorial of Linear Regression. More information on Python and Machine Learning can be found in the
 [wiki](https://github.com/packday/HGP_MachineLearning/wiki).

### Anaconda Installation
Anaconda is the leading open data science platform for the Python language. It is a high performance distribution of
Python and R, that includes over a 100 of the popular data science packages for Python, R, and Scala programming languages.
In addition by using conda, a package, dependency, & environment manager; you gain access to another 720 software packages,
a one stop shop for all of your data science needs.

Anaconda can be downloaded from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
